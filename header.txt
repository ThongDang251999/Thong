        //Identifies the client software (Postman) making the request, along with its version.
    Accept: */*
        //Indicates that the client can accept any type of response content (any media type).
    Postman-Token: 192bde6f-506a-4114-94bf-91a00bba469f
        //A unique identifier for the request, used by Postman to keep track of requests.
    Host: www.googleapis.com
        //Specifies the domain of the server to which the request is being sent (Google Books API in this case).
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
        //Informs the server about the acceptable content encoding types for the response, such as gzip, deflate, and Brotli compression.
    Connection: keep-alive
        //Tells the server to keep the connection open for future requests, instead of closing it after this one.

Response Headers

    Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
        //Specifies that the response body is in JSON format, with UTF-8 encoding.
    Vary: Origin
        //Indicates that the response may differ based on the "Origin" header in the request (used for handling cross-origin resource sharing).
    Vary: X-Origin
        //Similar to the "Origin" header, this specifies that the response may vary based on the "X-Origin" header.
    Vary: Referer
        //Indicates that the response can vary depending on the "Referer" header in the request, which usually shows the URL of the page making the request.
    Content-Encoding: gzip
        //Specifies that the response body is compressed using the gzip algorithm.
    Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 23:04:59 GMT
        //The date and time when the response was generated by the server, in GMT format.
    Server: ESF
        //The server software handling the request (in this case, itâ€™s Google's ESF server).
    X-XSS-Protection: 0
        //Indicates that cross-site scripting (XSS) protection is disabled by the server.
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
        //Prevents the page from being embedded in a frame or iframe unless the origin is the same as the page's origin (to protect against clickjacking attacks).
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
        //Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is declared (helps to avoid content-type sniffing attacks).
    Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
        //Specifies alternative services available for the request (HTTP/3, in this case). The ma indicates the maximum age in seconds.
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
        //The response body is sent in chunks, meaning the content is divided into smaller parts, each with its own size, rather than sending it all at once.
